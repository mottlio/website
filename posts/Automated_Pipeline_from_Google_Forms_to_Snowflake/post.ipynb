        "A while ago I worked on a project involving the analysis of large amounts of text data obtained from surveys using Google Forms.\n",
        "I was looking for ways to extract meaningful insights from many thousands of text submissions.\n",
        "I chose to work in Snowflake given the ability to use Python packages for natural language processing, Large Language Models for summaries and Streamlit for visualization.\n",
        "\n",
        "At the time, I loaded all of the data manually.\n",
        "However, I was curious what it would take to automate the data loading and create a live dashboard of the survey results.\n",

        "Our objective is to automatically load survey text data from Google Forms into Snowflake to later analyze it using its LLM capabilities.\n",
